# MutableJS
This works based on two things, mutables and bridges:
A mutable is like variable to store values, but mutables have a update method to change the value of it, so everytime that a mutable is updated, all data rendered in the DOM are updated as well.
A bridge works between the data input and the data output, so it can be used to treat the value by doing a calculation for example, or call data from an API, or just run a action for a button using the click event in a button.
